Project based on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux-ecommerce/) with a lot of changes:

- used only Ant Design UI (because why to use two UI libraries with same features);
- more complex Redux setup (there a lot of Redux here ðŸ˜‚);
- added mobile layout for all pages;
- new implementation for calculating average product rating (with mongoose middlewares + changes in the model);
- new implementation for filtering products feature (now we can combine filters for more specific results â€“ original project miss this functionality);
